# About At The Dinner Table

At The Dinner Table was created with one simple goal in mind: to arm people with information to face much needed discussions. We want to be a reliable, bite-sized and most importantly, fact-checked source of facts and resources that will help you when facing the tough talks we should all be having today. 

We want to help all the people that face the "not at the dinner table" reply when bringing up important subjects. Having hard facts and clear resources is an important first step in being taken seriously. That's where we want to help. We are always looking for important data and insights so you don't have to worry about that when you're in the middle of a tough discussion with the people you love (or don't). 

With that being said, we would love it if you could help us out! If you think an important piece of information is missing, or if you come across something that you think would be beneficial for others to see, you can contribute to our shared knowledge here! Because having reliable information is very very important to us, we'll ask you to provide a source for us to verify. Once you've contributed, we'll check it as soon as possible so people can start benefiting from even more information!

Even if only a single person sees this website and feels empowered to face a discussion head-on, we will have achieved our goal!



**Why is At The Dinner Table only about Black Lives Matter?**

Systemic racism is a huge problem in today's society. Sadly it has been like that for many years. That needs to end. At The Dinner Table was created when the protests demanding justice for George Floyd started and we want to support the international movement that followed. 
With that being said, there are more issues that need to be addressed. More discussions to be had. That's why we would love to expand into more subjects in the future. Do you have a subject in mind that you would like to see here? Let us know! 



**Why does At The Dinner Table only focus on the US?**

Racism and the unequal treatment of minority groups is sadly a global problem. However, the current movement in the United States needs all the support it can get and that is our first goal. If people would like to see more localized resources for other countries or specific areas, that is definitely something we would love to get into in the future! Feel free to reach out if that is something you are interested in.



# About us

Hi, my name is Niels Kersic. When the first protests started after the death of George Floyd, I felt I needed to do my part. I was inspired after seeing multiple tweets by very brave people, talking about how they brought up the issue of systemic racism to their families. Some of these people were successful, others not so much. They weren't being taken seriously. And I wanted to help them. I wanted to give people the power of saying "well, actually" in response to the many ideas that are based on prejudices and stereotypes. The ideas that prevent meaningful progress from being made.

Since I wanted to have something finished as soon as I could, I enlisted the help of my friend Sybren Janssen.
Together we spent much of our free time coming up with how to best provide people with much-needed information right at their fingertips and we hope we succeeded in that. If you have any suggestions on how to better achieve this goal, please let us know!

If you just want to chat, you can always send me a message on social media.
If this website helped you, we would love it if you could let us know!  We would also love it if you considered buying us a coffee so we can keep working on making this a great source of information for all <3



Thank you
